  ## 🛠️Installation🛠️
  Download the application, then install the necessary packages ( npm i) then seed your database, then run the server using your Git Bash. 
  
  Make sure you set the database in MySQL using the information in the schema.sql file.

  <ur>

  ## 📁Usage📁
 Start by running npm i in your Git Bash to install the dependencies needed to run this application.

Next, create the database in mySQL.

Once the database is created, you need to create a .env file to store your mySQL username, database name, and password.

After you have created the .env files, you need to seed the database by running npm seeds/index.js.

You can now run node server.js in your Git Bash to run the server.

The server is running at this point, so you can launch insomnia and begin testing the CRUD routes for Category, Product, and Tag.
